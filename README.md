# My-Journey

This repository walks you through my journey as a Data Enthusiast. 

One thing that intrigues my mind is that we humans are risk averse and we try to do our best to avoid risk. Think about the possibility that we would realize the occurence of disasterous event. 

we try to backup our research and findings using data. We conduct analysis to find root causes and uncertainities after the event has already occured. We are good at diagnostics, but in the coming disruptions in businesses diagnosis is not enough. We have to move forward by looking at the data backward. 

Machine learning and data mining techniques has equiped us with a power or predictability. Why not to use it and give prescriptions even before the disasterous event has occured. This was the point, I decided to move with the field of data science and predictive analytics. 

I use statistical and machine learning models to find useful insights from data and to make predictions that could help businesses make real-time decisions.

For more on what I do, please see my projects on the repositories I create.
